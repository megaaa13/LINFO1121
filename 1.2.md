# **1.2.1**
## CircularLinkedList
Iterator : thing which iterate
Iterable : something which we iterate on

### Time complexity
- Enqueue : 1
- Remove : n
- a sequence of operations which consists of creating an iterator and then iterating over the first k-elements : aucune idée

## ArrayStack
System.arraycopy(this.array, 0, newArray, 0, this.size);

### Time complexity
- public void push(E item) : 1
- a sequence of n push operations : n² if n is bigger than the actual array size, else n

# **1.2.2** : 
See PostFix.java in the code !

# **1.2.3** :
TODO

# **1.2.4** :
Non mais c'est abusé là c'est super chaud (TODO)

# **1.2.5** :
Does Java provide a class for Stack, Vector, List ? **java.util**
- Interesting to know for the exam
- List is an interface who permits to implements all the class Stack, LinkedList, Array, etc. But Queue is another interface which extends Collection

- List is an interface and cannot be instancied.
- Iterable is an abstract Class. He has to create a class who implements Iterable.
- n = n #Humour, it's necessary to put this.n = n, then the compiler can know which one is called.

- IDK
