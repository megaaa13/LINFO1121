/**
 * Context
 * --------
 * You have been contacted by an organizer of a drone artistic figure contest, because he is facing a problem that is a bit too complicated for his Excel sheet.
 * During the contest, several participants are going to make exhibitions of their drone and beautiful figures. Each participant had to reserve a time slot
 * before the contest and indicate the maximum height at which his drone will fly during his performance.
 * As these are powerful drones, they can fly very high, and this can cause problems for civil aviation. The organization in charge of the Belgian airspace,
 * Skeyes, therefore asks you to send them the maximum height used by the drones at any given time (the "profile").
 * You want it to be as accurate as possible, because any reservation costs money...
 *
 * Example
 * -------
 * Let's take an example. Let's have the following reservations:
 *
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | Drone | Start | Stop | Altitude |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | A     | 1     | 5    | 3        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | B     | 3     | 12   | 5        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | C     | 6     | 14   | 1        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | D     | 7     | 15   | 4        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | E     | 15    | 18   | 5        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | F     | 16    | 20   | 1        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 * | G     | 17    | 19   | 2        |
 * +-------+-------+------+----------+
 *
 * With these reservations, the profile is as follows:
 *
 * t ∈ [0,1[   ->  altitude = 0
 * t ∈ [1,3[   ->  altitude = 3
 * t ∈ [3,12[  ->  altitude = 5
 * t ∈ [12,15[ ->  altitude = 4
 * t ∈ [15,18[ ->  altitude = 5
 * t ∈ [18,19[ ->  altitude = 2
 * t ∈ [19,20[ ->  altitude = 1
 * t ∈ [20,∞[  ->  altitude = 0
 *
 * Details
 * -------
 * You need to implement a public static LinkedList<HeightChange> findHighest(Drone[] participants) method that takes as input an array of
 * Drone participants in the contest. Each drone is defined by a takeoff time (drone.start), landing time (drone.end) and a flight height (drone.height).
 * The drone is considered to be in flight during [drone.start,drone.end[.
 * You have the following properties:
 *
 *  1 ≤ drone.start < drone.end;
 *  1 ≤ drone.height;
 *  1 ≤ participants.length ≤100000.
 *
 *  As output, you need to provide the profile of the drones height as a function of time.
 *  This is a sequence of HeightChange objects that indicate that from the time change.time, the new maximum altitude is change.height.
 *  The HeightChange objects must be sorted by time (from smallest to largest time). The first change must have change.time=0.
 *  The last change must be when the last drone lands. Two successive changes must have different height.
 *
 *  Your profile must be optimal. In other words, given two successive changes a and b,
 *  the maximum altitude of drones flying between a.time (inclusive) and b.time (exclusive) is EXACTLY a.height.
 *  Therefore, there is a drone flying at altitude a.height between these two times.
 *

     * Given an array of participants (that starts their drones at a time given by drone.start (inclusive),

     * - They must be ordered by time
     * - The first height change must be at time 0, and at height 0.
     * - The last height change must be at the time the last drone stops (and thus must be at height 0!)
     * - Given two successive height changes A and B, the maximum height of any active drone between A.time (inclusive)
     * and B.time (exclusive) is EXACTLY A.height (i.e. there exists a drone with this height active between these
     * times). Moreover, A.height != B.height.
